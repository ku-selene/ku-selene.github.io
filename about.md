# **SELENE: Software Engineering Laboratory for Next-Gen Ecosystems**

**SELENE** (seh-LEE-nee) integrates classical principles of **Software Engineering (SE)** with state-of-the-art **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to develop and explore automated methodologies that make software more reliable (with fewer bugs) and easier to maintain. Rather than merely applying AI as-is, we emphasize ensuring that the resulting methodologies are *trustworthy* and *practical* in real-world settings.

## Our Principles


![](/assets/images/principles.png)

1. **Commitment to Better Software**: In the rapidly evolving software ecosystem, we continuously redefine what it means to build better software, explore this vision from multiple perspectives, and engage with all challenges necessary to realize it.

2. **Practical Impact**: Our goal is to develop flexible, practical, and effective methodologies that can be applied in real-world environments. To this end, we validate our approaches on real systems, sometimes using open-source projects and, when possible, through industry collaborations.

3. **Trust & Explainability**: We focus not only on applying AI to software engineering but also on automatically verifying the trustworthiness of its outcomes, ensuring that AI-driven tools remain transparent, reliable, and dependable.
