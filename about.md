## **SELENE: Software Engineering Laboratory for Next-Gen Ecosystems**

**SELENE** integrates classical principles of **Software Engineering (SE)** with state-of-the-art **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to develop and explore automated methodologies that make software more reliable (with fewer bugs) and easier to maintain. Rather than merely applying AI as-is, we emphasize ensuring that the resulting systems are *trustworthy* and *practical* in real-world settings.


### Research Focus
- **Fault Localization with LLMs**
- **Log Analysis**
- **Industrial Test Automation**
- **Bug-Inducing Commit Identification**
- **Documentation–Code Consistency Check**
- **Refactoring and Code Evolution**

> Please see the publications here: [SELENE Publications](/publications/)

### Our Principles
- **Commitment to Better Software**: In the rapidly evolving software ecosystem, we continuously redefine what it means to build better software, explore this vision from multiple perspectives, and engage with all challenges necessary to realize it.
- **Practical Impact**: Our goal is to develop flexible, practical, and effective methodologies that can be applied in real-world environments. To this end, we validate our approaches on real systems, such as Apache open-source projects and SAP HANA.
- **Trust & Explainability**: We focus not only on applying AI to software engineering but also on automatically verifying the trustworthiness of its outcomes, ensuring that AI-driven tools remain transparent, reliable, and dependable.
<!-- - **Open Science**: To promote reproducibility and broad adoption, we openly share benchmarks, tools, and datasets. -->
