# **Join Us** 💌

We’re looking for motivated students and collaborators who are excited about AI for Software Engineering (AI-for-SE) and want to build automated software engineering methods that make debugging and maintenance easier for developers.

We are recruiting **undergraduate and graduate research assistants**.

You’d be a great fit if you:

- Are interested in software engineering research, particularly topics related to testing, debugging, and maintenance
- Have strong engineering skills, with fluency in at least one programming language (e.g., Python, Java, or C/C++)
- Are comfortable with Linux/Unix environments

A plus (but not required):

- Prior experience in a research lab and/or industry
- Experience building software independently, including writing test cases

To apply, please email the PI (Gabin An) at gabin_an@korea.ac.kr with your **CV** and **academic transcript(s)** attached.
