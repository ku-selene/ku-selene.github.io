Our PI Gabin is visiting [FONDA](https://fonda.hu-berlin.de/), Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin from January 13 to January 27, with support from FONDA.

While in Berlin, Gabin will collaborate closely with [Prof. Lars Grunske](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske) and members of his software engineering research group. She is also scheduled to give a talk titled "*Finding Bugs at Scale: LLM-Based Fault Localization in Real-World Software*" as part of **FONDA’s Winter Lecture Series on January 20**.
