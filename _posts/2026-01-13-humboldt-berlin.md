Our PI Gabin An will be visiting [FONDA](https://fonda.hu-berlin.de/), Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin from January 13 to January 27. During this period, she will be temporarily away from Korea University. This visit is supported by funding from FONDA.

While in Berlin, Gabin will collaborate closely with [Prof. Lars Grunske](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/Members/lars-grunske) and his group members. She is also scheduled to give a talk at FONDA’s Winter Lecture Series on January 20.

If you happen to be visiting Berlin during this time and would like to connect, please feel free to reach out by email 😉
