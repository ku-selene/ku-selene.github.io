Our joint work with the [SAL Lab (led by Prof. Hakjoo Oh)](https://prl.korea.ac.kr/), “Pig: Leveraging Large Language Models for Python Library Migrations,” has been accepted to FSE 2026, to be held in Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦.

**Pig** introduces a novel approach to **automating Python library migration using large language models (LLMs)**. Although library migration is a routine task in modern Python development, existing LLM-based solutions often suffer from brittleness, frequent errors, and heavy reliance on documentation or example code.

To address these limitations, Pig adopts a structured four-step pipeline:

1. decomposing migration tasks at the API level to minimize irrelevant context,
2. guiding LLMs with prompts informed by common failure patterns and plausible API candidates,
3. selectively extracting migration-relevant code from LLM outputs, and
4. reintegrating the migrated code into the original program with post-processing to ensure semantic correctness.

In an evaluation on **364 API-level migration tasks**, Pig improves the average success rate of baseline approaches by **53.5% across seven different LLMs**.

📄 Preprint to appear soon. Stay tuned!
